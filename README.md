<h2>Project</h2>

This project seeks to analyse sales data for Buymore, a fast-growing supermarket in Ghana.

<a id="statement"></a>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Buymore, like many other data-driven companies, requires insights from their data to make informed decisions. As the Data Scientist for Buymore, the following tasks need to be addressed:

- Determine the average sales and profit per market.
- Plot a stacked bar chart showing the average sales and profit per market.
- Identify the market that brings more sales on average.
- Extract the days and months from the Order Date and add them to the data frame with the name "Days" and "Months" respectively.
- Show the trend of profit from January to December with a line plot.
- Identify the day that the company makes high sales on average.
- Determine the correlation between sales and profit, and what it means, and create a scatter plot to show the relationship between sales and profit.
- Plot a grouped bar chart showing the total profit for the different product categories for each market.
- Determine the product category that performs well in each market.
